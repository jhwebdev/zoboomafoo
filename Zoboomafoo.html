					<p> Zoboomafoo is an American-Canadian children's television series that originally aired on PBS from January 25, 1999 to November 21, 2001. It is still currently shown in syndication (depending on the area) and was regularly shown on Sprout until 2011. A total of 65 episodes were aired. A creation of the Kratt brothers (Chris and Martin), it features a talking Coquerel's sifaka named Zoboomafoo (voiced by Ottawa-born puppeteer Gord Robertson and mainly portrayed by Jovian) and a collection of repeat animal guests. </p>

					<p>Every episode begins with the Kratt brothers in Animal Junction, a peculiar place in which the rules of nature change and wild animals come to visit and play. After January 16, 2004, the series was pulled from its weekday airing on most PBS stations, though some continue to air it. The show is/was broadcast in the US, Canada, Latin America, Brazil, Australia, Spain, UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Middle East, India and Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina and the Republic of Macedonia in the Serbian language. On November 10, 2014, Jovian died of renal failure in his home at the Duke Lemur Center at the age of 20. </p>
